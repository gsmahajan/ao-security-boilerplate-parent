PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that authenticating to a PostgreSQL database account with an empty password was possible despite libpqs refusal to send an empty password. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to gain access to database accounts with empty passwords. (CVE-2017-7546)
